## Introduction

Object detection and recogntion is a demanding application in the area of machine learning and computer vision. Object detection using 3D techniques have beneficial impacts to mitigate real-world applications such as robotics, self-driving cars, security and many more.  There are several 3D object detection algorithms available to implement accurate object detection system to accomplish real-time delicate tasks. Nowadays, object detection using LiDAR point clouds or 3D representation of data has become neccesary to avoid imprecision in complex or unstructued scenes. This project is implemented to achive high accurate results in detecting objects using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and 3D point clouds.
