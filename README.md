## Introduction

Object detection and recogntion is a demanding application in the area of machine learning and computer vision. Object detection using 3D techniques have beneficial impacts to mitigate real-world applications such as robotics, self-driving cars, security and many more.  There are several 3D object detection algorithms available to implement accurate object detection system to accomplish real-time delicate tasks. Nowadays, object detection using LiDAR point clouds or 3D representation of data has become neccesary to avoid imprecision in complex or unstructued scenes. This project is implemented to achive high accurate results in detecting objects using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and 3D representation of data.

![flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37270872/129836235-811974e7-1167-459f-942b-e5676fd76fc3.png)

As we can see, above figure depicts the working flow of general object detection and recognition process. According to this figure, image features are generated while training the training images, and all images are labelled to classify further. After that in the testing phase, from the digital images or videos, image
features are extracted and classified to predict the object.

## Description

This project is using a 3D object detection approach without the prerequisite for particular operating system or Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in hand. As we know that 3D data offers well founded depth information to locate or detect any object accurately. These days, Point cloud representation is more favourable, as it can preserve the original depth information in 3D space without lossing any precious information. To add to it, point clouds representation is also convenient to be transformed to other file formats. A project is using a open-source Kaolin PyTorch framework to detect the objects accurately using 3D models. This framework is very approachable in loading and processing 3D datasets. 

In the project, a model is trained using ModelNet10 datasets including total 10 3D object categories to train high quality deep network. A model is traned using a graph convolutional network. A complete project is implemented by following total five stages including data loading, data pre-processing, training, evaluating and testing. A project has used the follwoing technologies to implement an excellent object detection application in order to evaluate the real-world significant problems.

## Motivation

These days, object detection and recognization is a challenging and difficult task to achive ideal results in the field of machine learrning and computer vision. So, 2D object detection using traditional techniques of object detection is not efficient to solve real-time problems. So, in order to solve this kinds of numerous issues 3D object detection and recognition has become a primary step in the field of machine learning to innovate different products that endorse human beings to ease their works in smart ways. Behind all the discussions, a real motivation is for me to explore some advanced 3D object detection techniques and to implement this project to achive the highest accuracy using data with 3D representation.

## Dataset

In this project, a proposed method of object detection is implemented using a ModelNet dataset. This  exceptional  dataset  offers two kinds of datasets including ModelNet10 and ModelNet40. A ModelNet10 dataset is containing total 10 categories of CAD models to train the deep neural network, and a ModelNet40 dataset consists of total 40 categories of CAD models to train the deep neural network. This project is utilizing the ModelNet10 dataset to speed up the performance in the training  process to come up with the solution in a less amount of time. Morever, training and testing data is already split in the ModelNet dataset, so we do not need to split the data for training and testing by utilizing split methods. A ModelNet10 dataset containes 10 categories, namely toilet, sofa, table, dresser, monitor, night stand, desk, bed, chair and bath tub. A ModelNet dataset consists of object files with object file format (OFF) that provides the information about geometry architecture of the object.

## Kaolin: A PyTorch Framework

This project is implemented using a Kaolin framework which is an open-source PyTorch library developed by NVIDIA following the 3D deep learning approach. Kaolin provides very convenient ways to load and preprocess the dataset without any issue. A Kaolin framework offers numerous built-in algorithms and techniques to ease our work in the application of object detection and recognition in the field of machine learning and computer vision. A primary goal of the Kaolin is to provide several easy-to-use tools in constructing 3D deep learning architectures.

## Graph Convolutional Networks

In this project, a model is trained using a graph convolutional network. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are the effective variant of the convolutional neural networks on graphs. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) learn a new feature representation by considering neighboring nodes for the multifarious features as similar as convolutional neural networks. Following figure represents the architecture of the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).

![graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37270872/129837495-9965ddff-a739-40fb-8722-1d0e80153606.png)

In graph convolutional networks, input neurons with a set of weights are multiplied, and it is also called kernels or filters. Kernels or filters proceed as a sliding window within the image and authorize convolutional neural networks to learn the different features from the neighboring nodes. A primary benefit of applying graph convolutional networks is that class labels are organized perfectly in the graph structure to understand the neural network easily.

## Results

I have experimented with various 3D methods and techniques, but a proposed technique has achieved exceptional results in detecting 3D objects. A traning process of the model has consumed around 20-25 minutes, as model will work for only 10 objects with providng the highest accuracy. Surprisingly, the trained model has provided around 93.34% accuracy in detecting 3D objects in testing phase. Moreover, I have scheduled and tried experiments several time, and I came to know that I was able to detect 30 objects out of 32 objects perfectly. So, I have achieved an expected result in the object detection process by employing the graph convolutional neural network.
