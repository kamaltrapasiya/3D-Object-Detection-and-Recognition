## Introduction

Object detection and recogntion is a demanding application in the area of machine learning and computer vision. Object detection using 3D techniques have beneficial impacts to mitigate real-world applications such as robotics, self-driving cars, security and many more.  There are several 3D object detection algorithms available to implement accurate object detection system to accomplish real-time delicate tasks. Nowadays, object detection using LiDAR point clouds or 3D representation of data has become neccesary to avoid imprecision in complex or unstructued scenes. This project is implemented to achive high accurate results in detecting objects using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and 3D representation of data.

## Description

This project is using a 3D object detection approach without the prerequisite for particular operating system or Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in hand. As we know that 3D data offers well founded depth information to locate or detect any object accurately. These days, Point cloud representation is more favourable, as it can preserve the original depth information in 3D space without lossing any precious information. To add to it, point clouds representation is also convenient to be transformed to other file formats. A project is using a open-source Kaolin PyTorch framework to detect the objects accurately using 3D models. This framework is very approachable in loading and processing 3D datasets. 

In the project, a model is trained using ModelNet10 datasets including total 10 3D object categories to train high quality deep network. A model is traned using a graph convolutional network. A complete project is implemented by following total five stages including data loading, data pre-processing, training, evaluating and testing. A project has used the follwoing technologies to implement an excellent object detection application in order to evaluate the real-world significant problems.

## Motivation

These days, object detection and recognization is a challenging and difficult task to achive ideal results in the field of machine learrning and computer vision. So, 2D object detection using traditional techniques of object detection is not efficient to solve real-time problems. So, in order to solve this kinds of numerous issues 3D object detection and recognition has become a primary step in the field of machine learning to innovate different products that endorse human beings to ease their works in smart ways. Behind all the discussions, a real motivation is for me to explore some advanced 3D object detection techniques and to implement this project to achive the highest accuracy using data with 3D representation.
